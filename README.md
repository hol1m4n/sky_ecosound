# Ecoacoustics

This repository contains some code that I wrote/used to process .wav files in order to explore correlations between ecoacoustic variables in a pristine area and certain celestial cycles. I utilized these codes during my bachelor's degree thesis. If you would like to learn more about what I did, you can check the following links:
