# Ecoacoustics

This repository contains some code to process _.wav_ files and explore correlations between the perodicity of ecoacoustic variables and certain celestial cycles.
Featuring tools:
  * **[ROOT](https://root.cern/)**
  * fftw
  * libsnd

I used these codes during my bachelor's degree thesis. If you would like to learn more about what we did, you can check the following links:
